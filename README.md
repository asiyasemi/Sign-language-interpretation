# Live Sign Language Interpretation Project
This project aims to build a sign language interpretation system using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to recognize hand gestures from images and classify them into corresponding sign language symbols.

## Overview
Sign language is an essential means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to interpret sign language gestures captured through images or video frames.

## Features
Recognize and interpret sign language gestures.

Multi-class classification for various sign language symbols.

Preprocessing techniques for image normalization and augmentation.

Training and evaluation of deep learning models for gesture recognition.

Model deployment for real-time interpretation.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow

OpenCV
scikit-learn
matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images capturing various sign language gestures. It is organized into different folders, each representing a specific sign language symbol.Training data is to be collected after running datacollection.ipynb into different folders inside data.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model architecture used for sign language interpretation includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, dense layers, and activation functions suitable for image classification tasks.

## Training
Load the sign language dataset.

Preprocess the images (resize, normalization, augmentation).

Define and compile the CNN model.

Train the model on the training dataset.

Evaluate the model on the testing dataset.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, loss, and classification reports. Testing the model with unseen data helps assess its generalization capabilities. Hyperparameters such as batch size, epochs, and optimizer can be adjusted as needed.
