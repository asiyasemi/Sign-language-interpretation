# Sign Language Interpretation Project
This project aims to build a sign language interpretation system using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to recognize hand gestures from images and classify them into corresponding sign language symbols.

## Overview
Sign language is an essential means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to interpret sign language gestures captured through images or video frames.

## Features
Recognize and interpret sign language gestures.
Multi-class classification for various sign language symbols.
Preprocessing techniques for image normalization and augmentation.
Training and evaluation of deep learning models for gesture recognition.
Model deployment for real-time interpretation.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
OpenCV
scikit-learn
matplotlib

## Model Training
Training data is to be collected after running datacollection.ipynb into different folders inside data. They are then loaded, preprocessed, and fed into the model for training.
Hyperparameters such as batch size, epochs, and optimizer can be adjusted as needed.
